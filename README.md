I can certainly do that! Here's the improved README content, ready for you to directly copy and paste onto your GitHub repository.

I've incorporated the following improvements to make it more engaging, clear, and professional for a GitHub audience:

Refined Language: Used stronger verbs and more active voice throughout.
Enhanced Engagement: Added more compelling phrasing to draw the reader in.
Consistent Tone: Maintained a confident and enthusiastic tone.
Clarity and Flow: Ensured smooth transitions between sections.
Minor Markdown Tweaks: Double-checked for optimal GitHub rendering.
Table: The agent team section now uses an HTML table for reliable rendering, as discussed.
🚀 Multi-Agent Document Processing System
🌟 Welcome to the Future of Document Intelligence!

Ever wished your software could read, understand, and process documents just like a human—but faster and more accurately? That’s exactly what this project delivers!

After a week of intense development and a complete code overhaul, I'm thrilled to present a next-generation, multi-agent system that makes document processing smarter, faster, and more reliable than ever.

🛠️ System Requirements & Dependencies
Before you dive in, let's make sure you have everything you need:

🐍 Python 3.8+ (The core of this project)
🤖 Ollama local AI server (For running powerful models locally)
🧠 Mistral AI model (default) (The intelligence driving the operation)
💾 At least 4GB RAM (To ensure smooth performance)

What's New? (The Big Refactor!)
Let's be honest: every developer has that moment when they look at their own code and think, "Who wrote this garbage?" Well, that was me just a week ago.

So, I did what every brave developer does—I rewrote everything from scratch!

Here's what changed:

🧠 Split the Overworked Classifier Agent:
Now, a Pure Classifier Agent handles classification exclusively.
A Dedicated PDF Agent takes over all PDF processing—making it faster and more consistent.
⚡ ~7% Speed Boost:
Experience a tangible performance improvement, depending on your machine and LLM response times.
🛡️ Bulletproof Fallback:
If the AI ever encounters an issue, the system gracefully falls back to rule-based classification, ensuring continuous operation.
🧹 Cleaner, More Maintainable Code:
The entire codebase has been meticulously rewritten for enhanced clarity and future expandability.
🎯 95%+ Accuracy:
Even when AI models are slow, the system consistently delivers top-tier results.

✨ Why You'll Love This Project
📄 More Consistent PDF Processing: Bid farewell to messy, unreliable PDF handling.
🎯 High Accuracy, No Matter What: The system adapts to slow AI models and still delivers exceptional results.
💪 Code You'll Be Proud Of: Clean, modular, and remarkably easy to extend.
🚀 Ready for the Future: The new architecture simplifies adding new agents or features.
🚀 Installation Guide
